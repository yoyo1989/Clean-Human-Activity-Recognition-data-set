Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
========================================

# Purpose
To demonstrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

# Description
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

# This repository contains the following files
1. README.md
2. CodeBook.md: describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data
2. UCI HAR Dataset: data in CodeBook.md
4. run_analysis.R: read in the data in UCI HAR Dataset, perform transformations or work in CodeBook.md, output a tidy data    
5. AveVar.txt: a tidy data set output from run_analysis.R
